# About

The purpose of the UCF Scientific Club is to learn about modern tools and mathematical techniques relevant for developing and deploying scientific codes. Researchers from all areas are welcome since we are a transdisciplinary group.  The planned meeting time is Mondays at 12:00 pm, starting on 2017-10-02 in collaboration area of PII. We have a list of <a href="plans.html">planned topics</a>, but so far no specific schedule.
